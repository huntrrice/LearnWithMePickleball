                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>When I teach clinics, I often open with: "Playing pickleball is my favorite thing in the world ‚Äî and teaching it is a close second." I've been immersed in racket sports my whole life: swinging a tennis racket as soon as I could hold one, playing ping pong in the basement growing up, and picking up pickleball in 3rd grade (back in 2012).</p>
                    
                    <p>What I love most about pickleball is the endless variety and strategy behind every shot ‚Äî and the fact that there's always something new to learn. I'm especially grateful to be part of this exciting era of pickleball, where there's no one right way to play. Styles, techniques, paddles, and strategies are still evolving ‚Äî and that's what makes it so fun.</p>

                    <p>While I'll always be learning myself, the heart of this coaching platform is to help you grow as a player ‚Äî whether you're here for tips, strategy, drills, or deeper insights into the game. Thanks for stopping by ‚Äî I'm excited to be part of your pickleball journey.</p>
